Humanity is screaming through the speakers, “Hey You”, looking for connection, of areas of greys with others of bright colors. People are home, creating a whole universe of planets locked inside. “Together we stand, Divided we fall”. Colors are starting to finally conquer the grey.","type":"richtext","uuid":"e58ffc28-8df5-46c0-b3ac-fafe757d47e5","scale":[1.1,2.4,0],"inverted":false,"position":[-4.2,7.6,3.75],"rotation":[0,0,0]},{"url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/694616849413046352/702815455416680498/Metal_wall.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"012604dc-b40f-4759-bfdb-e8f39c1967dd","scale":[1,2.5,0],"stretch":false,"inverted":true,"position":[-4.25,7.6,3.75],"rotation":[0,0,0]},{"url":"https://opensea.io/assets/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/9320","type":"nft-image","uuid":"2c8c3ec7-1d8e-4684-85a9-9f2848b5003c","color":false,"scale":[2.5,2.5,0],"stretch":false,"inverted":false,"position":[-2.25,3,1.5],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0]},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/694616849413046352/702981633644560444/Podmork_HOD_32red.vox","type":"vox-model","uuid":"130db077-bc48-4710-9263-6838c8aa36e9","flipX":true,"scale":[0.7,0.7,0.7],"position":[-5.95,1.25,4],"rotation":[0,-3.14,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]}},{"text":"Melissa - Kaysha","type":"sign","uuid":"f74c451d-d428-4e89-a9e4-aff321e5bf7b","scale":[0.5625,0.5,0.5],"fontSize":"15","inverted":true,"position":[2.5,5.8,0.15],"rotation":[1.57,-1.57,0]},{"url":"https://opensea.io/assets/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/9520","type":"nft-image","uuid":"cf2808d8-5fea-4fd1-841a-7188bf44c532","color":false,"scale":[3,3.7,0],"stretch":false,"inverted":false,"position":[6.25,3,-0.5],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0]},{"link":"https://superrare.co/artwork-v2/superrare-network---random-layout-9320","text":"SuperRare network Random layout - hex6c","type":"sign","uuid":"ce3444b9-1f58-41ff-85f8-f17b170ffa0e","scale":[1.37109375,0.5,0.5],"fontSize":"15","inverted":true,"position":[-1.75,1.5,0.9],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0]},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/694616849413046352/703162426303971368/PancaNera.vox","type":"vox-model","uuid":"dbb1b145-0fd7-4e9f-a75c-51691984e384","flipX":true,"scale":[3.2,3,3],"position":[2.35,5.25,-0.25],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]}},{"text":"#####WHITE DADA\n\n“Sincerity is scary”.\nWhite Dada’s works, enamel on canvas, are statements. Words are important, and we thank the artist for reminding us in a time where they seem to have lost their power. The process doesn’t matter, it starts in digital, it becomes physical, it goes back to digital and animation. Sometimes they look too extended, some others they even disappear. But they are there, words, asking us for just a little change of perspective to be still seen . That code of signs that allowed societies and humans to communicate.\n","type":"richtext","uuid":"d2c51028-2958-4d7d-ae6b-e3c90e619488","scale":[1.1,2.4,0],"inverted":false,"position":[-5.4,7.6,3.75],"rotation":[0,0,0]},{"url":"https://opensea.io/assets/0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/4706","type":"nft-image","uuid":"918cb238-5222-4db3-81ce-53fa6630c4e2","color":false,"scale":[3,3,0],"stretch":false,"inverted":false,"position":[-7.75,5.75,-7.25],"rotation":[0,3.141592653589793,0]}],"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"voxels":"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","owner":"0xE7079Eec020DDfC3F1c0abe1D946C55E6Ed30eB3","lightmap_status":"None","parcel_users":[{"wallet":"0x21316e6a4f0af45e5f1503984e83b10c53b177d8","role":"contributor"}],"description":null,"name":"ETHTurin","label":null,"address":"1 Cross Junction","suburb":"The Center","island":"Origin City","x1":-93,"y1":0,"z1":-75,"x2":-72,"y2":13,"z2":-67,"tileset":"/uploads/atlas/7530b93a2e57cd7cdb1aac979a4b84d3ee5c0277.png","palette":["#ffffff","#888888","#000000","#ff71ce","#01cdfe","#05ffa1","#b967ff","#fffb96"],"is_common":false,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
