The modules can be connected together with patch cords, a matrix patching system, or switches by the user to create a patch. The output (voltages) from the modules may function as (audio) signals, control voltages, or logic/timing conditions. Typical modules are oscillators (operate on frequency), filters (spectrum), amplifiers/gates (amplitude) and Envelope generators (dynamic control).\n\n","name":"ðŸ”Œ ðŸŽ¹ Modular Synthesis","label":null,"address":"3 Wire Center","suburb":"Junkyard","island":"Origin City","x1":447,"y1":0,"z1":-199,"x2":454,"y2":8,"z2":-183,"is_common":false,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
