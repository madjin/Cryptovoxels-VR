The idea is to add a little bit every day, as both a journaling exercise and a way to maintain a sense of routine and focus amongst the chaos. \n\nSome of the symbols – drawn in my signature style of clean lines and quirky character-based imagery, telling a personal story – are quite literal and mundane, whereas others represent more abstract states of mind. I wanted to include a mix of both to more accurately represent my day-to-day experience. \n\nThe illustrations overshoot the outer edges so that I can treat the piece as an ongoing work-in-progress. I may extend the doodle and tokenise new panels later.\n","type":"richtext","uuid":"3fcf0527-df82-48a1-a401-b067e93b5350","scale":[2,2.4,0],"inverted":false,"position":[7.25,2.65,5.7],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0]}],"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"voxels":"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","owner":"0x970A02d284c4582F31A654eed4EcC99aC976e314","lightmap_status":"None","parcel_users":[{"wallet":"0xc5e08104c19dafd00fe40737490da9552db5bfe5","role":"contributor"},{"wallet":"0xd03c8ad4bebd854a36010b864520efa0e4c700ee","role":"contributor"}],"description":null,"name":"Neverland","label":null,"address":"25 Thrill Bypass","suburb":"Punks","island":"Origin City","x1":299,"y1":0,"z1":-425,"x2":314,"y2":6,"z2":-400,"tileset":"/uploads/atlas/05af78137c01a05d96698e8250eb96a97ea0909a.png","palette":null,"is_common":false,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
