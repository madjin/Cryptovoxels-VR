There are different categories listed like work, recreation, family, relationships, health, skills, aesthetics, athletics, and more. What is in our power to control at a given time? How might one invest in oneself first? What concrete details does wealth look like to you.. or happiness... or community? There are some blank pages for writing, but these pages look weathered. When was the last time you sat and checked in on yourself? The leaves are falling and times are changing.
