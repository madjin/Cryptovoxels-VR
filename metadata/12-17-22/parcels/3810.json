About\n\nJon Lowenstein is an artist who has spent decades documenting community - his own in Chicago’s South Side as well as communities of migrants from Central America to the US. He forges long-term, sometimes multigenerational relationships with his subjects, so his images tell very intimate stories of folks who live in communities whose true stories are often not told.\n  \nJon recently started archiving his work on the blockchain, reaching out to the cryptoart community to help raise funds for the completion of The Advocate, his first feature-length documentary. The Advocate tells the story of young black activists in Chicago's South Side, focusing on Jedidiah Brown, who has dedicated his life to fight for justice and peace in his community. \n\nThe film explores the mental health impact of doing this work in the face of relentless violence and neglect. It also examines how the ability to broadcast their own actions and experiences on Facebook Live has empowered activists and helped them make positive change in ways that had previously not been possible.\n\n","type":"richtext","uuid":"0bdcca98-efa7-466e-bb3a-f2ec3f3fb5eb","scale":[2.6,2.5,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[-5.5,3.25,-6.25],"rotation":[0,3.141592653589793,0]},{"url":"https://opensea.io/assets/0xfbeef911dc5821886e1dda71586d90ed28174b7d/203626/","type":"nft-image","uuid":"d36b2fc4-3480-40fb-8f53-9b50f3062c05","color":false,"scale":[4,2,0],"script":"","stretch":false,"inverted":false,"position":[-9.25,8.75,-3.25],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0]},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpSy5Yi9PM","type":"youtube","uuid":"72acb33a-97d5-4259-850c-a6948ed7a59f","scale":[6,3,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[0,4.35,-3.75],"rotation":[0,3.141592653589793,0],"screenRatio":"169"},{"id":"","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_hAYuy8_YE","type":"youtube","uuid":"e0e34063-40de-4abe-b30c-9731f12a36ba","scale":[4,2,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[6.5,4.25,-6.25],"rotation":[0,3.141592653589793,0],"screenRatio":"169"},{"text":"a project by Jon Lowenstein","type":"sign","uuid":"268a1c4a-cd3c-4cd5-a8ec-df19e857a895","color":"#000000","scale":[2.97421875,0.5,0.5],"script":"","fontSize":"46","position":[8.25,2.25,0.5],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Multiply","background":"#ffffff"},{"text":" The Advocate ","type":"sign","uuid":"7aa8411a-2137-49e8-b4ca-a08df7fa26ab","color":"#000000","scale":[2.32,0.5,0.5],"script":"","fontSize":"76","position":[8.25,5.25,0.5],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Multiply","background":"#ffffff"},{"url":"https://opensea.io/assets/0x11e246c34707f7b1d0ce7170026090630274d31a/4472","type":"nft-image","uuid":"65bb9c04-3a2c-4de8-8693-a5a77c80319a","scale":[0.75,1,0],"hasGui":true,"stretch":true,"version":"21031","hasFrame":true,"position":[-4.75,4,1],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"blendMode":"Combine","hasGuiResizable":false},{"url":"https://async.art/api/art/0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8-1816","link":"https://async.art/art/master/0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8-1816","type":"image","uuid":"0d97e9d3-872e-4efb-9770-50c36568f641","scale":[3.6,2.1,0],"uScale":1,"vScale":1,"opacity":"1.00","stretch":true,"version":"21031","position":[-9.75,5.25,-2.75],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":true},{"link":"https://knownorigin.io/jon-lowenstein","text":" Known Origin collection ","type":"sign","uuid":"31ec5dff-83b0-475c-8ce5-501e45c070d4","color":"#000000","scale":[2.5875,0.5,0.5],"script":"","fontSize":"46","position":[7.75,2,2],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Multiply","background":"#ffffff"},{"text":"\n# Ferguson, Missouri  - click to play \n\n\n\n\nThe 2014 Ferguson protests were a watershed moment for the modern civil rights movement in the United States.

Issues like police brutality, racial\ndiscrimination, and poverty still disproportionately affect minority communities. Documentary\nphotographer Jon Lowenstein has dedicated his practice to presenting the social effects of institutional\nviolence, engaging with the people in his photographs over the course of decades to show how these\nissues can impact more than just individual lives. Through projects like Shadow Lives USA and Ferguson,\nLowenstein has sensitively documented the struggles of the migrant crisis in the United States and the\nnational protests combating police brutality against Black people. In South Side, Lowenstein embraces\nhis adopted community of Chicago’s South Side to show the pains and joys that come with daily life in a\npolitically neglected neighbourhood.\n\n.\n\nLowenstein is one of the first documentary photographers to utilise the blockchain, furthering a new use\nof the technology to promote social justice and equity. The blockchain has become a popular method of\npermanently storing information in a way that is widely accessible to the public. Projects like the DADA\nCollective’s ‘No Justice No Peace’ and One / Off have also employed this technology to champion police\naccountability and increase visibility for artists from underrepresented groups. By placing his\nphotographs on the blockchain, Lowenstein has ensured that these records of his community are\npermanently embedded into the fabric of a nation-wide experience.\n\n.\n\nLowenstein’s newest project, The Advocate, takes a focused look at the activists fighting for a new\nAmerica from their home in the South Side of Chicago. As Lowenstein keeps pace with Jedidiah Brown\nand others, this Chicago neighbourhood reveals itself as a microcosm of American social violence and\nracism, mirroring the damaging effect this violence has on Black families and communities across the\nnation.

The wider city has recently experienced substantial economic revitalisation, but often this new wealth does not reach the city’s poorest, most vulnerable residents, frequently resulting in lives lost to poverty and violence. From births to funerals to the intimate moments in between, Jon Lowenstein has captured the lived experiences of his South Side community, engaging with them not only as a documentarian, but also as a neighbour. Through photographs, found ephemera, oral histories, and other gathered evidence, Lowenstein shows how the daily joys and tragedies of South Side residents speak to a greater narrative of economic and racial inequality in the United States.   \n","type":"richtext","uuid":"3b71b47a-ceb0-4589-9fda-b88d4baeb16d","scale":[2.3,2.5,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[-9.25,2.9,1.1],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0]},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/770984395254267915/773268472967987221/12_SouthSide_625_G_rt.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"aaa3792b-1742-4454-8560-46d27a15d18e","scale":[2,1.5,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":false,"position":[-7.25,2.25,6.75],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false}],"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"voxels":"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","owner":"0xBC2c67a59EC004d7127a63F0f99275E31B4883Cf","lightmap_status":"None","parcel_users":[{"wallet":"0x61987699055394c65355f2797d3e4e589f7fabf4","role":"contributor"},{"wallet":"0xeda3c84c141b5790c13e08a9e39028f8af2839d1","role":"contributor"}],"description":"Current exhibition: MOCDA Presents: Jon Lowenstein's THE ADVOCATE\n\nUpcoming in this space:\nCryptocouture is a collaboration between cryptoartists oculardelusion and y0b. It is inspired by the old-school haute couture ateliers of Paris, in particular Christian Dior, but with a surreal, space-age metaverse twist. Oculardelusion initiates the fashions in VR, sculpting them in Tilt Brush. She then sends the files to y0b who translates them into voxel wearables. Therefore each dress concept is represented and collectible not only in voxel wearables but also in VR NFTs in video and still image format, which also make available the original Poly file so that the owner can experience the dress and its environs inside VR itself. \n","name":"GALLERY OCULARDELUSION","label":null,"address":"21 Kunitachi Crescent","suburb":"West Tokyo","island":"Tokyo","x1":121,"y1":0,"z1":547,"x2":141,"y2":9,"z2":561,"brightness":0.5,"palette":["#ffffff","#888888","#000000","#ff71ce","#01cdfe","#d6d6d6","#b967ff","#fffb96"],"is_common":false,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
