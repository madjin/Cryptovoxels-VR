The lighter the green, the lower the leaf's volume. To determine this, use Pfeiffer's formula and write it in red. To determine this, write the leaf in black, and then in white. You will quickly realize that the leaf contains more air than it expends. This is because, if there is no room for the leaf to move at all, there is more air than there is available. Therefore, most plants will have to produce enough moisture to grow. However, remember to keep a steady rate of leaf rotation at minimum to maximize surface area and to minimize air input into the plant.\n\n1440x1440 60fps mp4","type":"richtext","uuid":"9abb2315-6f0f-470f-91fa-c9817358c47d","scale":[1.8,2,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[-1.8,3.2,4.7],"rotation":[0,0,0]},{"url":"https://ipfs.pixura.io/ipfs/QmSpmaomznq22AKTzpg3HU8Ehx1vH2UsE55cSCNxAs58t2/proximity_20210103_1740.mp4","type":"video","uuid":"40b499b7-80d7-44cd-9282-3832c6017d59","scale":[3.6,3.6,0],"script":"","inverted":true,"position":[-4.75,3.25,3.7],"rotation":[0,0,0],"blendMode":"Combine","previewUrl":"https://i.imgur.com/vtiCelL.jpg"},{"type":"lantern","uuid":"328b1346-5ebc-4dc0-ac1c-e21c30493d2e","color":"#deb7e6","scale":[0.5,0.5,0.5],"position":[-5.5,3.8,1.1],"rotation":[0,3.141592653589793,0],"strength":"50"},{"text":"#Merged\n\nWhat color is it?
