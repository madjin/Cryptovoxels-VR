As the island got empty, becase Necro, Tilt, the air faction and their followers left it, the blacksmiths decided to get together with the Earth faction to mine the Abundance land that were empty for more than 100 years. They were having children at this time, that needed the land and crystals to develop their activities. Drog, from the Earth faction, decided to put on vote the new land reform law. The blacksmiths, leaded by Anna, built their new Fire faction and joined the miners, from the new Earth faction, and they had mined Abundance until the other factions retunred.","collection_id":294,"collection_name":"The Philosopher Brand","collection_address":"0xBbf177CE3afeFFa489f06D6Cf928Cd1D58b7DE30"},"showTryOnPopUp":false},{"url":"https://media-crvox.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/0xb7d3a787a39f25457ca511dc3f0591b546f5e02f/1638725966195-6d7873c7-a674-4bcd-a335-a7c88fdf3e1a.vox","type":"vox-model","uuid":"94ffeb17-9afe-49a9-815a-e42e89d5838a","flipX":true,"scale":[2,2,2],"version":"15062","position":[-2.25,0.9,2.5],"rotation":[0.69813,-0.7854,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[],"destination":null}},{"url":"https://media-crvox.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/0x36354da80c30e3b1045ae2dd7640a99d12d7bcbb/1644907630598-14035ed8-bb32-40e0-a80f-bac1bfa491bd.vox","type":"megavox","uuid":"bc448252-1cf8-48f3-9601-b881e5b09d9a","flipX":true,"scale":[6.1,3.5,4.8],"version":"20733","position":[-0.17,-1.19,0.32],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[],"destination":null}},{"url":"https://i.gifer.com/origin/19/195c4db0e36f6d3c0e331568b7c292ae_w200.gif","type":"image","uuid":"b2c40fb5-4fbd-4941-9125-2aff11b01d3d","scale":[3.8,5.6,0],"uScale":1,"vScale":1,"opacity":"1.00","stretch":true,"version":"20733","position":[-1.42,1.29,0.04],"rotation":[1.5707963267948966,-0.004351767488490896,0],"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false}],"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"voxels":"eJzt2UFygkAQhtF4A4+co2fBQquU4Z8K0tC+19shwUn1tzC335vZce6T8wNfrHpfu43+QK56X7uN/kCuel+7jf5Arnpfu43+QK56X7uN/kCuel+7jf5Arnpfu43+QK56X5ONXt70Xv4m2dvqD6Tq93N8evZ9q89v9UV/4KGyPKP+zL7vWc5vdUV/4OGs/Vnb+bnT8+fXnkhvMKmK/sDivP2Zfd99zh/Rn+cCbZ2Ezq7Wn0/3Sn/gOFfrT9U3QOkN6g/kztyffXo1WxT9gaOcuT/v1fzHLL1B/YGc/mTn0xvUH8jpT3Y+vUH9gVz3/qy/z9yNpDeYVOX5049PQm/6kz2R3qD+QK62P6Pz7952tlezP3/9mfQG9Qdy1+rP+Df87/T4qfQG9QdyV+lP9jvmP9fe96A/kPtUbb51Xhu73PPat1+Vf3uoVr2v3WatM/oDr6r3tdvoD+Sq97Xb6A/kqve12+gP5Kr3tdvoD+T+AMRiwmU=","owner":"0x40F5Bdf623E0E3BbE4008Bbd6Ee2E9e2DC44CbBA","lightmap_status":"None","parcel_users":[{"wallet":"0x690129b4a8fa04b5c5a81980816b1fe633356f56","role":"contributor"},{"wallet":"0xb7d3a787a39f25457ca511dc3f0591b546f5e02f","role":"contributor"}],"description":null,"name":null,"label":null,"address":"47 Fault Line","suburb":"Bronze","island":"Scarcity","x1":-1502,"y1":-3,"z1":-1123,"x2":-1487,"y2":9,"z2":-1111,"tileset":"/uploads/atlas/d2dd82199083ca37e08596e84034aec9539bb8bf.png","is_common":false,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
