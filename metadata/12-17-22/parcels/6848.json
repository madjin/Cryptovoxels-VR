From that day on, Self decided to collect the best experiences of real life, from all places, and times, and rebuild them in its then desolate world. When it touched the VOID with its thin structure, all the empty land, the pure space of possibilities, started to be built, voxel by voxel; and, from that origin point, the city spread, full of wonders.
