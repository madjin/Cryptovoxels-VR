Esses GTs se dividem de acordo com a temática investigada. O GT de Metafísica Analítica é relativamente novo e ainda tem poucos membros, mas os temas nele trabalhados são variados e todos centrais no debate metafísico contemporâneo internacional. A sua investigação se caracteriza pelo rigor lógico e conceitual com o qual aborda esses tradicionais tópicos da metafísica. Embora os assuntos tratados tenham sido, em sua grande maioria, tópicos abordados e discutidos em reuniões remotas do GT, nem todos os membros do nosso grupo estão aqui representados. Esperamos apresentar seus trabalhos em futuros livros. Por enquanto, queremos apenas divulgar ao público acadêmico algumas de nossas produções, trabalhadas e produzidas exclusivamente para este livro. Segundo a caracterização tradicional, com a qual plenamente concordamos, a metafísica se ocupa com a natureza mais íntima e geral da realidade. Essa metafísica é, por um lado, ambiciosa: não pretende apenas expor a realidade segundo o modo como ela se apresenta para nós, mas como ela é ‘em si mesma’. Por outro lado, ela é modesta: ela sabe da sua dívida para com as outras disciplinas, especialmente lógica, linguagem e epistemologia. Além disso, ela se entende como sempre tentativa, provisória, aberta a críticas e revisões. Neste livro, tratamos temas como as categorias ontológicas fundamentais e as suas relações de dependência e de fundamentalidade, a natureza da composição mereológica, da persistência temporal e do próprio tempo, a natureza dos objetos abstratos e dos mundos possíveis, as naturezas do mundo quântico, da causalidade nômica do mundo físico, e, finalmente, de um dos objetos mais característicos da presença humana no nosso mundo físico, que é o objeto de arte.","collection_id":626,"collection_name":"The Philosopher's Library","collection_address":"0x0E09f9427efEf1e411C3793B5D32b30925a72BC6"}},{"url":"","type":"collectible-model","uuid":"18eebfa9-9a21-45fc-8b82-afd97281a517","scale":[1,1,1],"version":"17915","position":[-0.4,3.45,-4.3],"rotation":[1.5708,-0.69813,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[],"destination":null},"collectible":{"id":"0d513959-4614-4aed-a2d2-a13b606bb8d2","hash":"d5a81714d0ba210ff473cd845320cb6f38aad700","name":"The Philosopher's Books: A Center Ideology (Uma Ideologia de Centro)","author":"0xe330dc28b47d73884ad88837aecfee1f49ad7e7b","category":"facewear","chain_id":137,"quantity":1,"token_id":3,"suppressed":false,"description":"All the books published by The Philosopher are completely free to download.

Preferi chamar de “Uma Ideologia de Centro” em vez de “Ideário”, pois o termo “Ideologia” é instigante para um título. Entretanto tenho a noção de que essa palavra é bastante carregada de significados teóricos. No modelo marxista, grosso modo, a ideologia é um conjunto de crenças, construído pela parcela dominante da sociedade, para naturalizar a dominação. Não é nesse sentido que utilizo o termo “ideologia”. Gostaria de um significado mais neutro para ele, tal como um conjunto de crenças, valores e/ou ações que respeita um conjunto de princípios. Nesse sentido, podemos pensar em uma ideologia para a direita política, para a esquerda política e para o centro político. Normalmente dividimos o espectro político de acordo com esses princípios; entretanto outras divisões são possíveis, ou ainda pode ser o caso que nenhuma divisão seja realmente objetiva. Como devemos, então, pensar essa divisão? Quais princípios subjazem as ações de diferentes atores políticos? Numa época de polarização política entre esquerda e direita, faz sentido refletirmos sobre posições mais moderadas? Qual conjunto de crenças, valores e ações poderia constituir moderação no cenário atual? Nosso livro tenta trazer uma reflexão sobre o ideário de centro, apresentando pensadores que refletem sobre a possibilidade de estabelecermos um centro, sobre a relação entre a ciência e o centro, sobre reformas centristas, entre outras coisas. Nossa intenção é que este livro promova uma reflexão inicial estimulante, e não a palavra final sobre as ideias apresentadas. Nesse sentido, este livro é ensaístico e tenta produzir algo original, ainda que incompleto. Nosso livro não têm uma unidade de visão; e acreditamos que isso é um mérito, pois não tenta estabelecer, em definitivo, se há e o que é o centro, mas nos leva a pensar sobre o conceito. A reflexão filosófica tem a característica de nos aprofundar nas questões investigadas. Podemos não chegar numa resposta final, mas nosso conhecimento sobre o problema e sobre as respostas para ele aprimoram nossa capacidade reflexiva. Pode-se acabar não concordando com nada do que aqui foi escrito. Maravilha! Se esse é o caso, o mais importante é saber por que não concordamos e construirmos nossa própria crítica argumentativa. Mas não paremos na crítica; construamos também uma teoria positiva, uma visão de mundo. É a partir do processo de criação, crítica, destruição e reconstrução, que tornamos mais fortes as nossas visões de mundo. Parafraseando a maior celebridade filosófica de todos os tempos, Sócrates: a vida só vale realmente a pena, se refletida.\n\nNº de pág.: 130 | \nISBN: 978-65-87340-45-6 | \nDOI: 10.22350/9786587340456 | ","collection_id":626,"collection_name":"The Philosopher's Library","collection_address":"0x0E09f9427efEf1e411C3793B5D32b30925a72BC6"}},{"url":"","type":"collectible-model","uuid":"1b81f202-f273-4991-9761-dcb4537b19e3","scale":[0.5,0.5,0.5],"version":"17915","position":[0,3.55,-3.95],"rotation":[0,4.01426,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[],"destination":null},"collectible":{"id":"59a39ce6-5ab1-458e-9ec5-f45d8277f78a","hash":"771b58780cd4e2ac25baed0eec76836d26ec3552","name":"Scarcity Tales: Cyber Faction","author":"0xe330dc28b47d73884ad88837aecfee1f49ad7e7b","category":"facewear","chain_id":137,"quantity":1,"token_id":551,"suppressed":false,"description":"The Cyber Faction was formed by Tempus, after the great war.
