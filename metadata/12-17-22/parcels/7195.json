Or are they? I ask myself and wonder how they feel when touched. Soft like styrofoam or cold like porcelain. Do they float or sink, break or bounce? Like Ludwig Wittgensteins duck-rabbit, I can only imagine one possibility at a time. My mind is inevitably stuck in a spacio-temporal physical prison, not free to roam the hybrid worlds of conflicting possibilities\nlike those inhabited by Florian Adolph’s digital sculptures. But are they truly free? In the end, they also need a surface on which to manifest themselves. They are but instructions that manifest\nthemselves whenever summoned to the surface of our screens—a line of code, and nothing more.\n\n\nLike many of the works in the artist’s oeuvre, these sculptures exist in hard to define spaces\nbetween the virtual and the physical, between the hand made and the mechanical. They are digital\nrenderings, of course, yet they feel handmade. And they are, in a way. A hand is still controlling a\ndevice that navigates between code-lines and display-pixels. And it’s a painter’s hand, no doubt. I\nlook at them idly spin on their axis, displaying themselves like the objects they are. I imagine they\nwere found in a cave, a deep underground cave in a —verse, one of the sprawling —verses,\nmaybe even ours. Fantastic post-archaeological treasures that shine in their unspectacularly. A\nshell, a branch, a ring. Merely this, and nothing more.\n\nFor me, they float. They get carried away by the streams like coconuts from island to island. You\ncan find them on the beach amongst the tidewrack. Perhaps they grow roots when they reach the\nsands, slowly getting bleached by the scorching sun. Or perhaps they stay as they are, like\npyroplastic, defiant of all the eroding powers around them. I pick up the shell and put it up against\nmy ear. I hear the sound. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. Tis the wind, and nothing more.\n\n\n\nBen Livne-Weitzmann ","type":"richtext","uuid":"f791d9d1-76e9-4a16-b0bd-07c0d4ac31ba","scale":[2.2,2.6,0],"version":"23405","inverted":false,"position":[2.2,8.9,-12.57],"rotation":[1.5708,3.14159,0]},{"id":"serene-give","type":"group","uuid":"3c8c77a9-bacf-45f1-aa57-ca4f97cd0ea3","scale":[1,1,1],"version":"23543","position":[0.47,4.3,6.25],"rotation":[0,0,0]}],"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"voxels":"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","owner":"0x8A6f87FC5DDB9e936854578D7EC4965A2CC2269B","lightmap_status":"None","parcel_users":[{"wallet":"0x120ae249843a5a231d416789686eaad2d8b66e77","role":"contributor"}],"description":null,"name":"Studio","label":null,"address":"43 Onasilos Ave","suburb":"Milky Way","island":"Andromeda","x1":-5194,"y1":-3,"z1":1904,"x2":-5183,"y2":15,"z2":1934,"tileset":"/uploads/atlas/c2716b597e0445246f8b2b87c47314ff0ffe9fe6.png","brightness":1.5,"is_common":false,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
