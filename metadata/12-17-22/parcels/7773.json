Abundance grew in technology and wealth, and the gnomes developed wonderful machines with god-like capabilities, like flying machines, healing machines and they could even talk to the dead.

This was not an easy task, and for doing so Necro gathered a large group of gnomes to go to Flora Island meeting the great immortal druid. Klava, the druid was alive since immemorial ages, and he is known for being immortal and for having an open passage to the underworld.
