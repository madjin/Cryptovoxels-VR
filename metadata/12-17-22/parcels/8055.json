He walks through all seasons of Chronos, but his hat remains the same. In Chronos, he abandoned the construction of air vehicles and began to dedicate himself to the construction of similarly sophisticated, but energy-less machines, the clocks. He then created an excellent central clock for the landscaping of Star and Sunshine, Spring leaders. Although all citizens were able to adjust the pendulum clock, since it was switched to an electric one, only Tim and Rick are able to tamper with it. But he refuses to fix the watch until the island changes its energy form. Get the solar panel and Rick the scientist, and Tim will fix the watch.","collection_id":294,"category":"headwear","author":"0xe330dc28b47d73884ad88837aecfee1f49ad7e7b","hash":"561b61f4822948992913c73391841edaf99d43f0","suppressed":false,"chain_id":137,"collection_address":"0xBbf177CE3afeFFa489f06D6Cf928Cd1D58b7DE30","collection_name":"The Philosopher Brand","quantity":2}}],"settings":{},"voxels":"eJzt1EEJADAMwMBBjU/6NBQG+dzFQ+bOlw7A0p/7+A+w5z9AxX+Aiv8AFf8BKv4DVPwHqPgPUPEfoOI/QMV/gIr/ABX/ASr+A1T8B6j4D1DxH6DiP0DFf4DKAzfvcIA=","owner":"0xa253D7cd38dC2D0B2E65AD42a7e4bEB3C60A83aD","lightmap_status":"None","parcel_users":[{"wallet":"0x5e67ea09afe651a3b87b346568bdc89152c625fc","role":"owner"}],"description":null,"name":null,"label":null,"address":"Spring Gardens 94","suburb":"Spring","island":"Chronos","x1":3455,"y1":0,"z1":-1874,"x2":3465,"y2":16,"z2":-1865,"palette":["#E7AFC6","#888888","#000000","#db398a","#01cdfe","#05ff16","#b967ff","#fffb96"],"is_common":true,"visible":true,"kind":"plot"}}
