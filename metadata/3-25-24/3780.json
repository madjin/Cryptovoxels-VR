WARS AND THEIR ALLIES\nAn exhibition by Cibele Vieira\n\nLorimoto Gallery\n1623 Hancock Street\nRidgewood, Brooklyn, NY 11385\n\nDecember 5-27, 2020\n\n\nA series of monochromatic watercolor paintings that the artist\nCibele Vieira started in 2018 and it is first inspired by children’s\ndrawings and invokes nature, climate change and war in an\napocalyptic and surreal future. \n\nEmploying watercolor techniques\ncommonly used to depict nature, gardens and beautiful landscapes,\nVieira created war scenes in outer space and environment\ndisasters. The watercolors range from 9x12 inches to 4x10 feet. The\npigment used in the watercolor is made from the insect Cochineal,\nwhich lives on prickly pear cacti. The use of this pigment to depict\nthese battle scenes contradicts the Tardigrade's toughness -\nCochineals are tiny insects that are extremely sensitive to climate\nconditions that are farmed at the foot of the Chilean Andes where the\ntemperature must be kept at a constant.  First used by the lost Aztec, it is now very popular for coloring sweets, jellies and even meats.\n\n.\n\nCochineals are one of the species at risk of extinction in the wild due\nto climate change.\nMost of the paintings were made during this year’s pandemic while\nthe artist lived in social distance and were made possible with the\nGrant For Individual Artists from the Queens Council on The Arts.\n.\n\nThe exhibition was curated by Gaudêncio Fidelis and the virtual\ngallery was made in collaboration with the artist Lenara Verle.","type":"richtext","uuid":"d70ca685-562d-44d6-9113-a4033c8dcb5a","scale":[2.8,4,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[2.75,3.35,0.95],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0]},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782897879701258260/11x14.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"8558435b-c487-4da4-b65e-bfcf08455b60","scale":[1.5,2,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[-1.15,9.25,5.65],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898087702167562/17x13-7352.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"f45e8e62-2691-4071-aa86-cfef55226290","scale":[1.5,1,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[1.6,9.3,5.6],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782897903503933460/12x9-7303.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"13247039-e8f8-4f73-8192-b417ea0d2fe3","scale":[2,1.5,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[-2.25,3.5,2.65],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782897936946036746/15.5x11.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"5203c223-2915-4ab3-982c-6b2d68910e1d","scale":[2.5,1.5,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[-2.55,4.95,-0.75],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898037093564446/17x13-7347.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"8e86f30e-5d39-4c8d-b04d-7e5e80c07075","scale":[2.1,1.5,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[-2.4,2.55,-0.55],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898157993328650/104x42_tardigradewars.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"26e75499-ffc7-48de-a7ce-54b852d53af7","scale":[8,3,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[2.8,8.3,-1.2],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898150011830292/82x42__the_battleof_the_bees.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"984134e5-daad-4ba6-9276-668e279fcc43","scale":[4,2,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[2.75,4,-3.35],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"text":"-","type":"polytext","uuid":"c4724e60-a9a0-438e-8e20-0fb05cac3318","color":"#000000","scale":[11.4,0.2,7],"script":"","position":[0.05,0.4,-13.35],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]}},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898149487411210/42x30_wise.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"d12015de-477a-4b0e-9446-feb5b0650421","scale":[3,2,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[2.75,6.4,-7.8],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782897884185493504/12x9_7291.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"b58c2267-b0be-4cf9-84a5-cc4305376e03","scale":[2.5,1.5,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[-2.05,7.55,-2.3],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898141955358720/49x48_the_back_of_the_Chickensour.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"8d77cf04-3727-4c74-93c6-9c91a1e6a184","scale":[4,4,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[2.45,2.8,-8.95],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782897712734404618/782898134954410004/52x42_hive.jpg","type":"image","uuid":"cd6147c5-99e0-4361-971a-8493e612a789","scale":[3,3,0],"script":"","uScale":1,"vScale":1,"stretch":true,"position":[2.5,5.25,-16.8],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"text":"#TARDIGRADES
