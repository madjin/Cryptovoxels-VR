In 1982, BL made 56,297 Minis. During the early 1980s, the Mini received many mechanical upgrades which were shared with the Metro, such as the A-Plus engine, 12-inch wheels with front disc brakes, improved soundproofing and quieter, stronger transmissions. This not only modernised the Mini but, because many of its major subassemblies were now shared with the Metro, made it very cost-effective to produce despite falling sales volumes. The Mini's 25th anniversary fell in 1984 and British Leyland produced a 'Mini 25' limited-edition model, both to mark the occasion and to publicise the recent upgrades to the model. This marked the start of a turnaround in the Mini's fortunes. Basic models such as the City and the City E (using the economy-tuned drivetrain from the Metro HLE) filled in the bottom of the Austin-Rover range and still found buyers who wanted a compact city car that was easy to park and cheap to run. Low purchase and running costs also made the Mini continually popular as a first car for younger drivers, and Austin-Rover introduced a steady stream of limited editions with bright paint colours, body graphics, and trim to appeal to this market. The Mini was also becoming prized as a characterful and nostalgic car in its own right, and the London Collection of limited-edition models was more upmarket and luxurious and named after affluent or fashionable parts of London. These marketing strategies proved very successful; Mini production actually had modest increases through the mid-1980s, from 34,974 in 1985 to 35,280 in 1985 and 39,800 in 1986. By 1990, with the reintroduction of the very popular Cooper model, Mini production passed 40,000. In 1988, Austin Rover decided to keep the Mini in production for as long as it was viable to do so, putting an end to reports that it would be discontinued by 1991, by which time the original Metro would also be replaced.","position":[-2.75,2.75,2.5],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"uuid":"3f68ea80-38f9-4800-98c5-b08aa2d84ba8"},{"type":"sign","scale":[2.025,0.5,0.5],"text":"Mark VII Mini (1996 - 2000)","position":[2.25,4,2.5],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"06d4869e-ee89-45c4-84f3-781134ad2a2a","fontSize":32},{"type":"sign","scale":[1.65,0.5,0.5],"text":"The final Classic Mini","position":[2.25,3.75,2.5],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"b24e9c9d-c2d7-4d22-a475-7613cade5a4e","fontSize":32},{"type":"sign","scale":[0.5,0.5,0.5],"text":"Rear Stripped","position":[2.75,8,3.25],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"4c455cdd-c66e-44b0-b258-249f973fbae4","fontSize":16},{"type":"image","scale":[1,1,0],"url":"http://minimuseum.info/images/CV/CV_StripdownRear.png","position":[2.75,8.5,3.25],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"b9de17bf-ead2-41ad-8a6d-7dd8779efc32","color":true},{"type":"image","scale":[1,1,0],"url":"http://minimuseum.info/images/CV/CV_StripdownEngine.png","position":[2.75,7.25,3.25],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"b4dc39eb-1392-4325-b7ca-817596bd9f51","color":true},{"type":"sign","scale":[2.2781249999999997,0.5,0.5],"text":"Mini Clubman and 1275GT (1969 -1989)","position":[2.75,4,2.5],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"uuid":"00bb3d99-df02-48c2-a9e5-23d9cb4cddaf","fontSize":27},{"type":"sign","scale":[0.75,0.5,0.5],"text":"Engine being removed","position":[2.75,6.5,3.25],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"b8051c1c-458f-4945-aa3a-784cd75b0b52","fontSize":16},{"type":"image","scale":[1,1,0],"url":"http://minimuseum.info/images/CV/CV_Clubman.png","position":[2.75,3.5,2.5],"rotation":[0,4.71238898038469,0],"uuid":"20b7ded2-17e7-4795-a2da-49c5ab603654","color":true},{"type":"image","scale":[1.5,1.5,1],"url":"http://minimuseum.info/images/CV/CV_Mark7finalMini.png","position":[2.25,3,2.5],"rotation":[0,1.5707963267948966,0],"uuid":"e56cb561-a8eb-44d9-85b9-cad684eadc70","color":true},{"type":"richtext","scale":[2,2,0],"text":"The Mark II Mini was launched at the 1967 British Motor Show.
