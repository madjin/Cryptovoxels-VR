Chomsky - Foucault - Orange Juice Debate 1971\n###03:36  \n03:37\nLadies and gentlemen,\n03:39\nwelcome to the fourth debate of the International Philosophers' Project.\n03:44\nTonight's debaters are Mr. Michel Foucault of the College de France\n03:51\nand Mr. Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n03:59\nBoth philosophers have points in common and points of difference.\n04:04\nPerhaps the best way to compare both philosophers\n04:08\nwould be to see them as mountain-diggers working at opposite sides\n04:14\nof the same mountain with different tools, without even knowing\n04:19\nif they are working in each other's direction.\n04:22\nAll studies of humanity, ranging from history to linguistics and psychology,\n04:29\nare faced with the question of whether in the last instance,\n04:34\nwe are the product of all kinds of external factors\n###04:37 \n04:38\nor if, in spite of our differences, we have something we could call\n04:43\na common human nature by which we can call each other human beings.\n04:48\nSo my first question is to Mr. Chomsky,\n04:51\nbecause you often employ the concept of human nature\n04:55\nin which connection you even use terms like \"innate ideas\" and \"innate structures\".\n05:01\nWhich arguments can you derive from linguistics\n05:05\nin order to give such a central position to this notion of human nature?\n05:12\nWell, let me begin in a slightly technical way.\n05:19\nA person who is interested in studying languages\n05:22\nis faced with a very definite empirical problem.\n05:26\nHe's faced with an organism, a mature, let's say adult speaker,\n05:32\nwho has somehow acquired an amazing range of abilities,\n05:38\nwhich enable him in particular to say what he means,\n05:43\nto understand what people say to him,\n05:45\nto do this in a fashion that I think is proper to call highly creative.\n05:50\nNow, the person who has acquired this intricate and highly articulated\n05:56\nand organized collection of abilities\n05:59\n-- the collection of abilities that we call knowing a language --\n06:02\nthat person has been exposed to a certain experience; he has been presented\n06:08\nin the course of his lifetime with a certain amount of data,\n06:13\nof direct experience with a language.\n06:14\nWe can investigate the data that's available to this person; having done so,\n06:21\nin principle, we're faced with a reasonably clear and well-delineated scientific problem,\n06:29\nnamely that of accounting for the gap between the really quite small quantity of data, small\n06:38\nand rather degenerate quantity of data that's presented to the person, to the child, and\n06:43\nthe very highly articulated, highly systematic, profoundly organized resulting knowledge that\n06:51\nhe somehow derives from this data.\n06:53\nFurthermore -- even more remarkable -- we notice that in a wide range of languages,\n06:59\nin fact all that have been studied seriously, there are remarkable limitations\n07:05\non the kinds of systems that emerge from the very different kinds\n07:09\nof experience to which people are exposed.\n07:13\nThere is only one possible explanation, which I have to give in a rather schematic fashion,\n07:19\nfor this remarkable phenomenon, namely the assumption\n07:25\nthat the individual himself contributes a good deal, an overwhelming part in fact,\n07:35\nof the general schematic structure and perhaps even of the specific content of the knowledge\n07:41\nthat he ultimately derives from this very scattered and limited experience. That is,\n07:47\nto put it rather loosely: the child must begin with the knowledge, certainly not with the\n07:52\nknowledge that he's hearing English or Dutch or French or something else, but he does start\n###07:55 \n07:57\nwith the knowledge that he's hearing a human language of a very narrow and explicit type,\n08:02\nthat permits a very small range of variation. And it's because he begins with that highly\n08:07\norganized and very restrictive schematism, that he is able to make the huge leap from\n08:13\nscattered and degenerate data to highly organized knowledge.\n08:18\nI would claim then that this instinctive knowledge, if you like,\n08:23\nthis schematism that makes it possible to derive complex and intricate\n08:28\nknowledge on the basis of very partial data, is one fundamental constituent of human nature.\n###08:33 \n08:34\nAnd I assume that in other domains of human intelligence, in other domains of human cognition\n08:40\nand even behavior, something of the same sort must be true.\n###08:43 \n08:46\nWell, the collection, this mass of schematisms, innate organizing principles\n08:53\nwhich guides our social and intellectual and individual behavior,\n08:58\nthat's what I mean to refer to by the concept of human nature.\n###09:02 \n09:04\nWell, Mr. Foucault, when I think of your books like\n###09:09 \n09:09\nThe History of Madness and Words and Objects, I get the impression that you are\n09:14\nworking on a completely different level and with an opposite aim and goal;\n###09:18 \n09:22\nwhen I think of the word 'schematism' in relation to human nature\n09:27\nI suppose you are trying to elaborate\n09:29\nseveral periods, several schematisms. What do you think about this?\n09:36\nWell if you permit, I will answer in French\n09:38\nbecause my English is so bad that I would be ashamed of answering in English.\n09:45\nIt is true that I mistrust the notion of human nature a little.\n09:53\nAnd for the following reason: I believe that of the concepts\n10:02\nor notions that a science can use, not all have the same degree of elaboration.\n10:16\nLet's take the example of biology. Within the field of biology\n10:23\nthere are concepts that are more or less well established, like the concept of a \"reflex\".\n10:29\nBut there also exist peripheral notions, which do not play an \"organizing\" role within science,\n10:45\nthey are not instruments of analysis and they are not descriptive either. These notions\n10:54\nsimply serve to point out some problems, or rather to point out certain fields in need of study.\n11:04\nFor instance, there exists a very important concept in the field of biology:\n###11:11 \n11:11\nthe concept of life. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the notion of life was\n11:24\nhardly used when studying nature: one classified natural beings, whether living or non-living,\n11:31\nin a vast hierarchical tableau. Life was a concept they didn't use and didn't need.\n11:40\nAt the end of the eighteenth century a number of problems arose, for instance in relation\n11:47\nto the internal organization of these natural beings. Moreover, thanks to the use of the\n11:57\nmicroscope, different sorts of phenomena and mechanisms that had been unclear in the past\n12:07\nand could not have been perceived until then suddenly came to light.\n12:12\nThe developments in chemistry have also highlighted certain problems in relation\n12:18\nto the connections between chemical reactions and the physiological processes of organisms.\n12:25\nAnd that's how an entire field appeared,\n12:27\none that was completely new for biologists, one that is nowadays known as life.\n12:35\nLife was a concept that served to point out new fields of study that science still\n###12:43 \n12:44\nhad to discover. I would say, as a historian of science, that the concept of life was an\n12:52\nepistemological indicator; an index of the problems that still had to be uncovered.\n12:58\nAnd I ask myself whether perhaps one could say the same thing about human nature.\n13:04\nFoucault is therefore comparing Chomsky's concept of human nature\n13:08\nwith the concept of life as used in biology and in the history of that science.\n13:12\nHe does this because his sees of the concept of human nature\n13:16\nmore as an indication of a research program\n13:20\nrather than as an indication of humanity's potential for achievement.\n13:26\nFor him, human nature acts as a scientific shopping list and nothing more.\n13:32\nChomsky is willing to accept this as long as it is clear that the fields\n13:37\nof biology, physiology and neurology still don't have the means\n13:42\nto adequately describe human nature and humanity's capacity for language.\n13:48\nQuite early on in the debate, moderator Mr. Elders\n13:54\nfinds it difficult to keep the interaction flowing between the two speakers.\n13:58\nThis is partly due to the different languages they speak, but most importantly due to the\n14:03\nfact that Chomsky and Foucault inhabit such different worlds of thought, to the point\n14:10\nin which their ideas easily slide past each other. We actually observe the curious phenomenon\n14:15\nof two brains thinking simultaneously, where one picks up the last claim of the other in\n14:23\norder to further elucidate it from his own system of thought.\n14:28\nFor Chomsky the concept of creativity plays an important role,\n14:33\nand the following part of the debate will be largely dedicated to this issue.\n14:36\nFor Chomsky creativity is actually acharacteristic of all human beings.\n14:41\nEverybody uses it. People stuck in traffic who unexpectedly and on the spot,\n14:46\nhave to think about what to do next.\n14:48\nThe educator who doesn't want to fall into a pattern of authoritarian behavior\n14:53\nand when confronted with a difficult pupil, has to invent new behavior.\n14:57\nBut above all, this creativity applies to the child\n15:01\nwho learns a language and who curiously learns to produce new language.\n15:11\nFoucault is opposed to this idea. He constantly emphasizes\n15:14\nthe so-called \"epistemological field\" within which human activity takes place.\n15:22\nThis \"epistemological field\" or \"épistèmè\"\n15:26\nis described as the totality of unconscious rules\n15:31\nthat manage the totality of all separated fields of knowledge.\n15:37\nFoucault also talks of \"tableau\", and also calls it \"system of elements\",\n15:43\nand in the debate the word \"grille\" is mentioned: bar or grid.\n15:47\nPerhaps it's best to speak of a network within which everybody in\n15:52\na particular culture thinks whether they want it or not.\n15:54\nIt is a certain set of rules to which everybody's thinking obeys\n15:59\nand with which people search for identity, coherency and so forth.\n16:05\nThis system is not a creation of particular individuals:\n16:11\nit decides the rules of the \"think-and-do\" habits we call culture, which every individual\n16:19\nis subjected to. Such a system is not a thing or idea, but lies precisely in between these.\n16:29\nFor Foucault the history of thought is not be associated with the history of ideas\n16:33\nor even of the development of the mind,\n16:37\nbut rather it should be understood as discontinuous transformations.\n16:44\ntransitioning from one network to another.\n16:47\nThat is a totally different approach from that of Chomsky,\n16:51\nfor whom creativity plays a central role. At this point we encounter\n16:56\nFoucault's dethroning of the subject, as already illustrated with the example of Galilei.\n17:05\nThe philosophy of Foucault is a philosophy in which the philosopher\n17:09\nconstantly disappears from sight.\n17:12\nOne could say that, paradoxically, it is a philosophy without philosophers:\n17:17\nan idea to be generalized because humans are, according to Foucault, greatly absent\n17:24\nwithin their own culture. In this respect, Foucault's strong and negative reaction\n17:32\ntowards the moderator who showed interest in private matters of his life.\n17:38\nWhen Foucault debates, it is about everything except Foucault himself.\n17:43\nThis is an introduction to the following -- quite detailed -- theoretical part of the debate\n17:49\nwhich seems to mainly focus on one question:\n17:54\nto what extent is the individual able to discover something new,\n17:59\nand if so, how should we make sense of this? This seems to me to a very relevant question,\n18:06\nespecially if we remind ourselves that we need quiet some new forms\n18:11\nof behavior, knowledge and science if we want to survive together in this world.\n18:19\nWe resume the debate where Foucault explains why he doesn't pay much attention\n18:25\nto the creativity of the individual from a historical perspective.\n18:31\nWithin the traditional history of science,\n18:33\nthe creativity of individuals has been accorded maximum importance. The history of science,\n18:44\nup until recently, essentially consisted of showing how an individual -- whether it was\n###18:47 \n18:52\nNewton or Mendel -- had been the creator, or rather the discoverer of a reality that\n18:59\nwas already existing in things and in the world, a reality that no other person had\n19:09\npreviously discovered. I believe the postulate that lies at the core of the traditional history\n19:16\nof science is that truth exists in order to be known; yet the human mind, due to the effect\n19:28\nof a number of inhibitions or obstacles, has not managed to see this truth. The mind is\n19:37\nmade to see the truth and a contingent obstacle is impeding him to see it. According to some\n19:46\nhistorians, this obstacle could be linked to socio-economic conditions, or to different\n19:49\nforms of mentality, or to the belief and naivety in old religious myths and moral themes.\n19:57\nAll of these could act as obstacles, as blinders to those who want to see the truth. In reality,\n20:07\nthe mind is meant to see, it is made to have access to the truth. In this traditional conception\n20:14\nof the history of science, on the one hand there is an emphasis on the creativity of\n20:21\nthe individual who has the right to possess the truth, and yet a system of obstacles will\n20:30\nprevent him from capturing, formulating and constructing this truth to which he is essentially\n20:40\nentitled to possess. I believe the problem that is being posed is the exact opposite.\n20:47\nWhat happens when we witness a great scientific transformation? In a great scientific\ntransformation\n###20:52 \n20:57\n-- for instance the birth of biology mid seventeenth century, or the birth of philology\n21:04\nat the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century -- it is true that\n21:08\na number of obstacles, prejudices, preconceived ideas tumble and disappear. What strikes me,\n21:16\nhowever, is that science, at the moment of its birth, not only gets rid of a certain\n###21:20 \n21:24\nnumber of obstacles but also eliminates and masks a certain amount of existing knowledge.\n21:34\nIt's as if applying a new grid, which allows for the appearance of phenomena\n21:44\nthat had been previously masked while at the same time masking already existing knowledge.\n21:49\nTherefore, a science, the advancement of science and the acquisition of science, is not simply\n21:55\nthe oblivion of old prejudices, or the fall of certain obstacles. It is a new grid that\n22:01\nmasks certain things while allowing for the appearance of new knowledge. Therefore, when\n22:06\nI criticize the notion of creativity, what I mean is that truth is not acquired through\n22:14\na kind of continuous and cumulative creation, but rather through a set of grids stacked\n22:20\non top of one other, which leak old and collect new knowledge.\n22:24\nI think in part we're slightly talking at cross-purposes,\n22:27\nbecause of a different use of the term creativity. In fact, I should say that\n22:31\nmy use of the term creativity is a little bit idiosyncratic\n22:36\nand therefore the onus falls on me and not on you in this case.\n22:39\nBut when I speak of creativity, I'm not attributing\n22:44\nto the concept, the notion of value that is normal when we speak of creativity.\n22:52\nThat is, when you speak of scientific creativity,\n22:56\nyou're speaking, properly, of the achievements of a Newton.\n22:59\nBut in the context in which I have been speaking about creativity,\n23:03\nit's a normal human event.\n23:05\nI'm speaking of the kind of creativity that any child demonstrates when he's able\n23:15\nto come to grips with a new situation: to describe it properly, react to it properly,\n23:22\ntell one something about it, think about it in a new fashion for him and so on.\n23:28\nI think it's appropriate to call those creative acts,\n23:32\nbut of course without thinking of those acts as being the acts of a Newton.\n###23:35 \n23:36\nIt's the lower levels of creativity that I've been speaking of.\n23:40\nNow, as far as what you say about the history of science is concerned, I think\n23:44\nthat's correct, illuminating and particularly relevant in fact to the kinds of enterprise\n23:50\nthat I see lying before us in psychology, linguistics and the philosophy of the mind.\n23:57\nThat is, I think there are certain topics that have been, in your words, repressed\n24:03\nor put aside during the scientific advances of the past few centuries.\n24:10\nBut now, I think, we can overcome those,\n24:14\nit is possible to put aside those limitations and forgettings, and to\n24:19\nbring into our consideration precisely the topics that animated a good deal of\n24:24\nthe thinking and speculation of the seventeenth and eighteenth century,\n24:28\nand to incorporate them within a much broader and I think deeper\n24:31\nscience of man that will give a fuller role\n24:39\n-- though certainly not expected to give a complete understanding to such notions as\n24:45\ninnovation and creativity, freedom and production of new elements of\n###24:49 \n24:57\nthought and behavior within some system of rule and schematism.\n25:01\nThose are concepts that I think we can come to grips with.\n25:03\nIn reality, I believe there is a quite strong similarity\n###25:05 \n25:06\nbetween what Mr. Chomsky said and what I tried to show:\n25:09\nin other words there exist in fact only possible creations, possible innovations.\n25:18\nOne can only, in terms of language or of knowledge,\n25:22\nproduce something new by putting into play a certain number of rules\n###25:29 \n25:30\nwhich will define the acceptability or grammaticality of these statements, or which\n25:38\nwill define, in the case of knowledge, the scientific character of the statements.\n25:44\nThus, we can roughly say that linguists before Mr. Chomsky mainly insisted on\n25:50\nthe rules of construction of statements and less on the innovation\n25:59\nrepresented by every new statement, or the hearing of a new statement.\n26:05\nAnd in the history of science or in the history of thought,\n26:08\nwe placed more emphasis on individual creation\n###26:10 \n26:13\nand we had kept aside and left in the shadows these communal,\n26:22\ngeneral rules, which obscurely manifest themselves through\n26:27\nevery scientific discovery, every scientific invention,\n26:32\nand even every philosophical innovation. These are not only linguistic rules\n###26:35 \n26:36\nbut also epistemological rules, which characterize contemporary knowledge.\n26:41\nWell I think... Perhaps I can try to react to those comments\n26:46\nwithin my own framework in a way which will maybe shed some light on this.\n26:50\nHow is it that we are able to construct any kind of scientific theory at all?\n26:54\nHow is it that, given a small amount of data, it's possible for various scientists,\n27:00\nfor various geniuses even, over a long period of time,\n27:04\nto arrive at some kind of a theory, at least in some cases,\n27:07\nthat is more or less profound and more or less empirically adequate?\n###27:09 \n27:11\nThis is a remarkable fact.\n27:12\nAnd, in fact, if it were not the case that these scientists, including the geniuses,\n27:18\nif they didn't have built into their minds somehow an obviously unconscious\n27:24\nspecification of what is a possible scientific theory,\n27:28\nthen this inductive leap would certainly be quite impossible:\n27:31\njust as if each child did not have built into his mind\n27:35\nthe concept of human language in a very narrowing way,\n27:39\nthen the inductive leap from data to knowledge of a language would be impossible.\n27:44\nSo even though the process of, let's say, deriving knowledge of physics from data\n###27:48 \n27:50\nis far more complex, far more difficult for an organism such as us,\n27:55\nfar more drawn out in time, requiring intervention of genius and so on and so forth,\n27:59\nnevertheless in a certain sense the achievement of discovering physical science\n28:06\nor biology or whatever you like, is based on something rather similar\n28:11\nto the achievement of the normal child in discovering the structure of his language:\n28:15\nthat is, it must be achieved on the basis of an initial limitation,\n28:19\nan initial restriction on the class of possible theories.\n28:23\nAnd the fact that science converges and progresses\n28:26\nshows us that such initial limitations and structures exist.\n28:30\nThat is, I don't think that scientific progress is simply a matter of\n28:34\naccumulative addition of new knowledge and the absorption of new theories and so on.\n28:41\nRather I think that it has this sort of jagged pattern that you describe,\n28:46\nforgetting certain problems and leaping to new theories.\n28:49\nAnd transforming the same knowledge.\n28:51\nRight. But I think that one can perhaps hazard an explanation for that fact.\n28:58\nOversimplifying grossly, I really don't mean what I'm going to say now literally,\n29:03\nit is as if, as human beings of a particular biologically given organism,\n29:08\nwe have in our heads, to start with, a certain set of possible intellectual structures,\n29:15\npossible sciences. Okay? Now, in the lucky event that some aspect of reality\n29:21\nhappens to have the character of one of these structures in our mind, then we have a science.\n29:27\nAnd it is because of this initial limitation in our minds to a certain kind of possible science\n29:36\nthat provides the tremendous richness and creativity of scientific knowledge.\n29:41\nIt is important to stress -- and this has to do with your point about limitation and freedom\n29:47\n-- if it were not for these limitations, we would not have the creative act of going\n29:53\nfrom a little bit of knowledge, a little bit of experience, to a rich and highly articulated\n29:58\nand complicated array of knowledge. It is precisely because of this that the progress\n30:01\nof science has the erratic and jagged and transformational character that you described.\n30:09\nAnd that doesn't mean everything is ultimately going to fall within the domain of science.\n30:13\nQuite the contrary. Personally I believe that\n30:16\nmany of the things we would like to understand,\n30:19\nand maybe the things we would most like to understand,\n30:21\nsuch as the nature of man, or the nature of a decent society,\n30:26\nor lots of other things, might really fall outside the scope of possible human science.\n30:30\nWell I think we have now two questions out of this statement.\n30:35\nOne question is: Mr. Foucault, if you agree with the statement about\n30:41\nthe combination of limitation, fundamental limitation?\n30:44\nIt is not a matter of combination.\n30:45\nCreativity only becomes possible thanks to a system of rules:\n30:53\nit is not a mixture of order and freedom.\n30:58\nFreedom can only be truly exercised thanks to a system of regularity.\n31:06\nWhere perhaps I don't completely agree with Mr. Chomsky is\n31:13\nwhen he places these regularities within the sphere of the human mind or human nature.\n31:22\nI would like to know whether one cannot discover this system of regularity and of constraint\n31:27\n-- which makes science possible -- somewhere else, even outside the human mind:\n31:34\nin social forms, in relations of production, in class struggles, etc.\n31:40\nBut what does this theory of knowledge mean for your theme of the death of man\n31:46\nor the end of the period of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries?\n31:52\nBut this is not related to what we are talking about?\n31:55\nI don't know, because I was trying to apply what you have said\n32:04\nin relation to your anthropological concept. You have already refused to speak\n32:10\nabout your own creativity and freedom, haven't you?\n32:13\nWell, I'm wondering what are the psychological reasons for this.\n32:19\nWell, you can wonder about it, but I can't help that?\n32:21\nBut what are the objective reasons, in relation to your perception of understanding,\n32:30\nof knowledge, of science, for refusing to answer these personal questions?\n32:36\nDoes it have to do with your conception of society?\n32:42\nWhen there is a problem for you to answer:\n32:46\nwhat are your reasons for making a problem out of a personal question?\n32:50\nNo, I'm not making a problem out of a personal question;\n32:53\nI make of a personal question an absence of a problem.\n32:56\nIn the entire tradition of the history of thought, ideas and sciences,\n###33:01 \n33:03\none has always questioned the problem of knowing.\n33:06\nAt what age was Newton weaned into conceiving the universal law of gravity?\n33:13\nAt which period did Cuvier meet his first mistress\n33:18\nin order to finally discover fossils and comparative anatomy, etc?\n33:23\nI believe these types of analyses, which I am now simplifying, are not very interesting.\n33:30\nOn the other hand, it is much more interesting to understand the transformations of a certain\n###33:34 \n33:36\nknowledge within the general field of science and within the so-called vertical field\n33:45\nwhich consists of a society, a culture, a civilization at a particular moment in time.\n33:50\nOnce we finally grasp the totality of this transformation,\n33:54\nwe realize that the little individual moments of a wise man's life are not important.\n34:01\nAgain Foucault's last comment suggests how the individual life\n34:07\nof the researcher tends to disappear from sight.\n34:09\nBut how do we explain then the relation of man in relation to its culture in politics\n34:17\nand maybe even the question about how to change this culture and society?\n34:19\nAfter all one can show within the history of science and culture,\n34:24\nthe input of the individual is almost negligible,\n34:29\nthe question 'how do I act?' -- the political question - remains standing.\n34:36\nIt may thus become clear by now that this political question, from Foucault's perspective,\n34:43\nrapidly develops into \"how far can mankind escape from its own culture?\"\n34:50\nIt is important to note that Foucault doesn't want to distance himself from politics.\n34:56\nIn the contrary, he says \"I would have to be ideologically blind\n35:01\nto not interest myself for that which is most substantial to human existence:\n35:06\neconomic relations, power relations, you name it\".\n35:10\nTherefore, Chomsky and Foucault do agree on the importance of the political question.\n35:12\nIn his opinion, it is required to abolish and destroy the different forms of capitalism\n35:13\nin order to favor direct workers' participation\n35:15\nIt may also be informative to explicitly mention that Chomsky defines his political standpoint\n35:23\nas anarcho-syndicalism.\n35:35\nin workers' councils and so on. Decentralization, socialization and participation\n35:42\nare keywords in Chomsky's political program.\n35:46\nChomsky might say he sees no obvious relation between his scientific and political views,\n35:52\nbut the following opening statement reveals\n35:55\nthat he heads straight from his scientific conceptions to politics.\n36:01\nHis political and scientific views may not flow logically one from the other,\n###36:05 \n36:06\nthey do certainly head in the same direction.\n36:09\nLet me begin by referring to something that we have already discussed,\n36:13\nthat is, if it is correct, as I believe it is, that a fundamental element of human nature\n36:20\nis the need for creative work, for creative inquiry, for free creation\n36:29\nwithout the arbitrary limiting effect of coercive institutions,\n36:36\nthen, of course it will follow that a decent society should maximize the possibilities\n36:43\nfor this fundamental human characteristic to be realized.\n36:47\nThat means trying to overcome the elements of repression and oppression\n36:55\nand destruction and coercion that exist in any existing society, ours for example,\n37:02\nas a historical residue. Now a federated, decentralized system of free associations,\n37:13\nincorporating economic as well as social institutions,\n37:17\nwould be what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism;\n37:20\nand it seems to me that this is the appropriate form of social organization for an advanced\n37:26\ntechnological society, in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position\n37:32\nof tools, of cogs in the machine. In which the creative urge that I think is intrinsic\n37:39\nto human nature, will in fact be able to realize itself in whatever way it will, I don't\n37:43\nknow all the ways in which it will.\n37:45\nI would say that I am much less advanced than Mr. Chomsky in this respect.\n37:51\nThat is, I admit not being able to define, not even to propose,\n38:02\nan ideal social model for the functioning of our scientific or technological society.\n38:11\nOn the other hand, one of the tasks that seems immediate and urgent to me,\n38:17\nover and above anything else, is this: it is the custom, at least in our European society,\n###38:18 \n38:26\nto consider that power is localized in the hands of the government\n38:32\nand that it is exercised through a certain number of particular institutions,\n38:37\nsuch as the administration, the police or the army.\n38:46\nOne knows that all these institutions are made to transmit and apply orders\n38:51\nand to punish those who don't obey.\n###38:55 \n38:57\nBut I believe that political power also exercises\n39:02\nitself through the mediation of a certain number of institutions that look as if they\n39:12\nhave nothing in common with political power and as if they are independent from it,\n39:18\nbut in fact are not. One knows the university and more generally all teaching systems,\n39:26\nwhich appear to disseminate knowledge, are made to maintain a certain social class\n39:41\nin power and to exclude the instruments of power of another social class.\n39:48\nAnother example is psychiatry\n39:51\nwhich in appearance is also intended for the good of humanity\n39:57\nand for the knowledge of psychiatrists.\n39:59\nBut in reality is another way to bring to bear the political power over a social class.\n40:07\nJustice is yet again another example. It seems to me that the real political task\n40:13\nin our contemporary society is to criticize the workings of institutions\n40:20\n-- particularly the ones that appear to be neutral and independent\n40:22\n-- and to attack them in such a way that the political violence,\n40:29\nwhich has always exercised itself obscurely through them,\n40:33\nwill finally be unmasked so that one can fight against them\n40:37\nIf we seek to advance straight away a profile or a formula of the future of society\n40:45\nwithout having thoroughly criticized relations between the different forms of political violence\n40:51\nthat exercise their power within our society, we run the risk of letting them be reproduced\n40:56\n-- even in the case of the noble\n41:00\nand apparently pure forms, such as anarcho-syndicalism.\n41:02\nYes, I would certainly agree with that, not only in theory but also in action.\n41:07\nThat is, there are two intellectual tasks:\n41:11\none, and the one which I was discussing, is to try to create the vision of a future just society.\n41:20\nAnother task is to understand very clearly the nature of power and oppression and terror\n41:27\nand destruction in our own society.\n41:29\nAnd that certainly includes the institutions you mentioned,\n41:32\nas well as the central institutions of any industrial society:\n41:38\nnamely the economic, commercial and financial institutions and in particular, in the coming period,\n41:46\nthe great multi-national corporations,\n41:48\nwhich are not very far from us physically tonight [i.e. Philips in Eindhoven].\n41:51\nThose are the basic institutions of oppression and coercion and autocratic rule\n41:59\nthat appear to be neutral despite everything they say:\n42:02\nwell, we're subject to the democracy of the market place.\n42:04\nStill, I think it would be a great shame to put aside entirely\n42:11\nthe somewhat more abstract and philosophical task of trying\n42:16\nto draw the connections between a concept of human nature that gives full scope to freedom\n42:25\nand dignity and creativity and other fundamental human characteristics,\n42:30\nand relate that to some notion of social structure in which those properties\n42:37\ncould be realized and in which meaningful human life could take place.\n42:41\nAnd in fact, if we are thinking of social transformation or social revolution,\n42:45\nthough it would be absurd of course to draw it out in detail\n42:49\nthe point that we are hoping to reach, still we should know something\n42:54\nabout where we think we are going, and such a theory may tell it to us.\n###42:56 \n42:58\nYes, but then isn't there a danger here?\n43:01\nIf you say that a certain human nature exists, that this human nature has not been given\n43:10\nthe rights and possibilities that allow it to realize itself in our contemporary society...\n43:18\nThat's really what you have said, I believe.\n43:19\nYes.\n43:20\nAnd if one admits this, doesn't one risk defining this human nature\n43:27\n-- which is at the same time ideal and real, and has been hidden and repressed until now\n43:33\n-- in terms borrowed from our society, from our civilization, from our culture?\n###43:34 \n43:42\nI will give an example by greatly simplifying it. Marxism -- at the end\n43:48\nof the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century -- admitted that in\n43:54\ncapitalist societies man hadn't reached its full potential\n44:01\nfor development and self-realization;\n44:04\nthat human nature was effectively alienated in the capitalist system.\n44:10\nAnd Marxism ultimately dreamed of a liberated human nature.\n44:17\nOn the other hand, what model did it use to conceive,\n44:26\nproject, and eventually realize that human nature?\n44:30\nIt was, in fact, the bourgeois model.\n44:31\nMarxism considered that a happy society was a society that gave room, for example,\n44:39\nto a sexuality of a bourgeois type, to family of a bourgeois type, to bourgeois type of aesthetic.\n44:47\nAnd it is moreover very true that this has happened in the Soviet Union:\n44:52\na kind of society -- simultaneously real and utopic -- had been reconstituted and\n45:06\ntransposed from the bourgeois society of the nineteenth century,\n45:10\nin which humans finally were able to realize their true nature.\n45:15\nThe result, that you also realized, I think, is that it is difficult to conceive\n45:19\nof what human nature precisely is.\n45:21\nIsn't there a risk that we will be led into error?\n45:25\nMao Zedong spoke of bourgeois human nature and proletarian human nature,\n45:30\nand he considers that they are not the same thing.\n45:32\nWell, you see, I think that in the intellectual domain of political action,\n45:36\nthat is the domain of trying to construct a vision of a just and free society\n45:43\non the basis of some notion of human nature, we face the very same problem\n45:48\nthat we face in immediate political action. For example, to be quite concrete, a lot of\n45:56\nmy own activity really has to do with the Vietnam War,\n45:58\nand a good deal of my own energy goes into civil disobedience.\n46:01\nWell, civil disobedience in the U.S. is an action undertaken\n46:09\nin the face of considerable uncertainties about its effects. For example, it threatens\n46:16\nthe social order in ways which might, one might argue, bring about fascism;\n46:17\nthat would be a very bad thing for America, Vietnam, Holland and for everyone else.\n46:26\nSo that is one danger in undertaking this concrete act. On the other hand there is a\n46:32\ngreat danger in not undertaking it, namely, if you don't undertake it, the society of\n46:37\nIndo-China will be torn to shreds by American power. An in the face of those uncertainties\n46:43\none has to choose a course of action. Well, similarly in the intellectual domain,\n46:47\none is faced with the uncertainties that you correctly pose.\n46:52\nOur concept of human nature is certainly limited;\n46:56\nit's partially socially conditioned, constrained by our own character defects and\n47:01\nthe limitations of the intellectual culture in which we exist. Yet at the same time it\n47:08\nis of critical importance that we have some direction, that we know what impossible goals\n47:16\nwe're trying to achieve, if we hope to achieve some of the possible goals.\n47:21\nAnd that means that we have to be bold enough\n47:22\nto speculate and create social theories on the basis of partial knowledge,\n47:30\nwhile remaining very open to the strong possibility,\n47:37\nand in fact overwhelming probability,\n47:39\nthat at least in some respects we're very far off the mark.\n47:44\nWell, perhaps it would be interesting to delve a little deeper into this problem of strategy.\n###47:47 \n47:50\nSo, for example, in the case of Holland, we had something like a population census.\n47:57\nOne was obliged to answer questions on official forms.\n48:02\nWould you call it civil disobedience if one refused to fill in the forms?\n48:07\nRight. I would be a little bit careful about that,\n48:10\nbecause, going back to a very important point that Mr. Foucault made, one does not\n48:16\nnecessarily allow the state to define what is legal. Now the state has the power to enforce\n48:22\na certain concept of what is legal, but power doesn't imply justice or even correctness,\n48:28\nso that the state may define something as civil disobedience and may be wrong in doing so.\n48:33\nFor example, in the United States the state defines it as civil disobedience to,\n48:39\nlet's say, derail an ammunition train that's going to Vietnam; and the state is wrong in\n48:44\ndefining that as civil disobedience, because it's legal and proper and should be done.\n48:49\nIt's proper to carry out actions that will prevent the criminal acts of the state,\n###48:51 \n48:53\njust as it is proper to violate a traffic ordinance in order to prevent a murder.\n48:58\nIf I was standing at a street corner and the traffic light were red,\n49:02\nand then I drove across traffic light to prevent somebody from, let's say,\n49:08\nmachine-gunning a group of people, of course that's not a violation of law,\n49:11\nit's an appropriate and proper action; no sane judge would convict you\n49:15\nfor such an action. Similarly, a good deal of what the state authorities define\n49:20\nas civil disobedience is not really civil disobedience:\n49:23\nin fact, it's legal, obligatory behavior in violation of the commands of the state,\n49:29\nwhich may or may not be legal commands.\n49:31\nSo one has to be rather careful about calling things illegal, I think.\n###49:34 \n49:35\nYes, but I would like to ask you a question.\n49:38\nWhen, in the United States, you commit an illegal act...\n49:46\nWhich I regard as illegal, not just the state...\n49:49\nWhen the state considers it illegal.\n49:55\nDo you justify your action in terms of justice of an ideal,\n50:04\nor do you justify it in terms of necessary class struggle?\n50:13\nAgain, very often when I do something which the state regards as illegal,\n50:19\nI regard it as legal: because I regard the state as criminal.\n50:23\nBut in some instances that's not true.\n50:25\nLet me be quite concrete about it and move from the area of class war\n50:31\nto imperialist war, where the situation is somewhat clearer and easier.\n50:35\nTake international law: a very weak instrument as we know, but nevertheless\n50:40\nit incorporates some very interesting principles.\n50:42\nWell, international law in many respects is the instrument of the powerful:\n50:47\nthat is, international law permits much too wide a range\n50:53\nof international forceful intervention in support of existing power structures\n50:59\nthat define themselves as states and against the interests of masses of people\n51:04\nwho happen to be organized in opposition to states.\n51:07\nBut, in fact, international law is not solely of that kind.\n51:11\nAnd in fact there are interesting elements of international law,\n51:14\nembedded in the United Nations Charter, which permit, in fact, I believe, require the\n51:18\ncitizen to act against his own state in ways that the state will falsely regard as criminal.\n51:26\nBut nevertheless, he's acting legally, because international law also happens\n51:30\nto prohibit the threat or use of force in international affairs,\n51:36\nexcept under some very narrow circumstances, of which, for example,\n51:39\nthe war in Vietnam is not one.\n51:41\nWhich means that, in the particular case of the Vietnam War,\n51:44\nwhich interests me most, the American state is acting in a criminal capacity.\n51:49\nAnd the people have the right to stop criminals from murdering people.\n51:53\nJust because the criminal happens to call your action illegal when you try to stop him\n51:59\ndoesn't mean it is illegal.\n52:00\nA perfectly clear case of that is the present case of the Pentagon Papers in the United States\n52:06\nwhich, I suppose, you know about. Reduced to its essentials and forgetting legalisms,\n52:10\nwhat is happening is that the state is trying to prosecute people for exposing its crimes.\n52:15\nThat's what it amounts to.\n52:18\nSo it is in the name of a purer justice that you criticize the functioning of justice?\n52:26\nIt is important for me to know about this.\n52:30\nIn France there is currently a debate\n52:35\nabout this problem of justice and that of popular judicial institution.\n52:43\nA certain number of people, including Sartre, believe that in order to make a critique\n###52:50 \n52:56\nof the current penal system or of police practices, we have to create a kind of tribunal\n###52:59 \n53:09\nwhich -- in the name of a superior, ideal and human justice -- will condemn the practices\n53:19\nof the French judges or policemen. Moreover, there is another group of people,\n53:25\nmyself included, who say this shouldn't be done because when they refer to an ideal justice\n53:37\n-- which the tribunal is supposed to apply --\n53:41\nthey refer to a certain number of judicial ideas which\n53:47\nwere formed in our time by a certain number of individuals who are themselves,\n53:52\ndirectly or indirectly, a product of their societies.\n###53:58 \n53:59\nWe have to attack the practices of justice.\n54:03\nWe have to attack the police and their practices:\n54:08\nbut in terms of war and not in terms of justice.\n54:13\nSurely you believe that your role in the war is a just role;\n54:18\nthat you are fighting a just war, to bring in a concept from another domain.\n54:22\nAnd that, I think, is important. If you thought that you were fighting an unjust war, you\n54:27\ncouldn't follow that line of reasoning.\n54:30\nI would like to slightly reformulate what you said.\n54:33\nIt doesn't seem to me that the difference is between legality and ideal justice;\n54:38\nit's rather between legality and better justice.\n54:42\nNow this better system may have its defects, it certainly will.\n54:46\nBut if comparing the better system with the existing system, without being\n54:52\nconfused into thinking that our better system is the ideal system, we can then argue,\n54:56\nI think, as follows: the concept of legality and the concept of justice are not identical;\n55:02\nthey're not entirely distinct either. Insofar as legality incorporates justice in this sense\n55:12\nof better justice, referring to a better society, then we should follow and obey the law,\n55:19\nand force the state to obey the law and force the great corporations to obey the law,\n55:23\nand force the police to obey the law, if we have the power to do so.\n###55:26 \n55:30\nIf in those areas where the legal system happens to represent not better justice,\n55:38\nbut rather the techniques of oppression\n55:40\nthat have been codified in a particular autocratic system,\n55:44\nwell, then a reasonable human being should disregard and oppose them,\n55:47\nat least in principle; he may not, for some reason, do it in fact.\n###55:49 \n55:51\nI would simply like to reply to your first sentence,\n55:55\nwhen you said that if you didn't consider the war you wage against the police\n55:59\nto be just, you wouldn't wage it. I would like to reply to you in terms of Spinoza\n56:06\nand tell you that the proletariat doesn't wage war against the ruling class\n56:14\nbecause it considers such a war to be just.\n56:16\nThe proletariat wages war against the ruling class because it wants\n56:22\nfor the first time in history, to take power.\n56:24\nAnd because of its will to overthrow power it considers such a war to be just.\n56:29\nYeah, I don't agree?\n56:30\nOne wages war to win, not because it is just.\n56:32\nI personally don't agree with that.\n56:34\nFor example, if I could convince myself that attainment of power by the proletariat\n56:39\nwould lead to a terroristic police state, in which freedom and dignity and\n56:49\ndecent human relations would be destroyed,\n56:53\nthen I wouldn't want the proletariat to take power.\n56:55\nIn fact the only reason for wanting any such thing, I believe, is because one thinks,\n57:01\nrightly or wrongly, that some fundamental human values will be achieved\n57:06\nby that transfer of power.\n###57:07 \n57:10\nWhen the proletariat takes power, it may be\n57:18\nquite possible that the proletariat will exert a violent, dictatorial and even bloody power\n57:32\ntowards the classes over which it has just triumphed.\n57:33\nBut if you ask me what would happen if the proletariat exerted bloody,\n57:36\nI can't see what claim anyone could make against this.\n57:45\ntyrannical and unjust power towards itself, then I would say that this could only occur\n57:52\nif the proletariat hadn't really taken power, but that a class outside the proletariat,\n57:55\nor a group of people inside the proletariat, or a bureaucracy or petit bourgeois elements,\n58:08\nhad taken power.\n58:10\nWell, I'm not at all satisfied with that theory\n58:12\nof revolution for a lot of reasons, historical and others.\n58:16\nBut even if one were to accept it for the sake of argument,\n58:19\nstill that theory is maintaining that it is proper for the proletariat\n58:26\nto take power and exercise it in a violent and bloody and unjust fashion, because it\n58:32\nis claimed, in my opinion falsely, that that will lead to a more just society,\n58:39\nin which the state will wither away,\n58:41\nin which the proletariat will be a universal class and so on and so forth.\n58:44\nIf it weren't for that further justification, the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat,\n58:51\nviolent and bloody, will certainly be unjust.\n58:54\nI for example, I am not a committed pacifist.\n58:57\nI would not hold that it is under all imaginable circumstances wrong to use violence,\n59:04\neven though use of violence is in some sense unjust.\n59:08\nI believe that one has to estimate relative injustices.\n59:11\nBut the use of violence and the creation of some degree of injustice can only itself\n59:20\nbe justified on the basis of the claim and the assessment -- which always ought\n59:25\nto be undertaken very, very seriously and with a good deal of skepticism -- that this\n59:30\nviolence is being exercised because a more just result is going to be achieved.\n59:35\nIf it does not have that grounding, it is really totally immoral, in my opinion.\n59:41\nAs far as the aim of the proletariat in leading a class struggle is concerned,\n59:52\nI don't think it would be sufficient to say that it is in itself a greater justice.\n60:00\nWhat the proletariat will achieve by expelling the ruling class\n60:06\nand by taking power is precisely the suppression of class power in general.\n###60:07 \n60:14\nBut that's the further justification.\n60:18\nThat is the justification, one doesn't speak in terms of justice but in terms of power.\n60:22\nIt is in terms of justice; it's because the end that will be achieved\n60:25\nis claimed as a just end. No Leninist or whatever you like\n60:32\nwould dare to say \"We, the proletariat, have the right to take power,\n60:37\nand then throw everyone else into crematoria.”\n###60:39 \n60:42\nIf that were the consequence of the proletariat taking power,\n60:45\nof course it would not be appropriate.\n60:47\nThe idea is -- and for the reasons I mentioned I'm skeptical about it -\n60:51\nthat a period of violent dictatorship, or perhaps violent and bloody dictatorship,\n60:57\nis justified because it means the submergence and termination of class oppression,\n61:03\na proper end to achieve in human life.\n61:06\nBut it seems to me that, in any case, the notion of justice\n61:11\nitself functions within a society of classes as a claim\n61:17\nand as a justification for it made by the oppressed class.\n61:23\nI don't agree with that.\n61:24\nAnd in a classless society,\n61:28\nI am not sure that we would still use this notion of justice.\n61:35\nWell, here I really disagree. I think there is some sort of an absolute basis\n61:41\n-- if you press me too hard I'll be in trouble because I can't sketch it out --\n61:45\nbut some sort absolute basis, ultimately residing in fundamental human qualities\n61:52\nin terms of which a \"real\" notion of justice is grounded.\n61:56\nI think it's too hasty to characterize our existing systems of justice\n62:05\nas merely systems of class oppression; I don't think that they are that.\n62:09\nI think that they embody systems of class oppression\n62:13\nand they embody elements of other kinds of oppression,\n62:16\nbut they also embody a kind of a groping towards the true humanly,\n62:23\nvaluable concepts of justice and decency and love and kindness\n###62:27 \n62:30\nand sympathy and so on, which I think are real.\n62:32\nWell, do I have time to answer?\n62:34\nYes\n62:36\nHow much? Because...\n62:38\nTwo minutes?\n62:41\nBut I would say that that is unjust?\n62:45\nAbsolutely.\n62:48\nNo, but I don't want to answer in so little time.\n62:52\nI will simply say that I can't help but to think that the concepts of human nature,\n63:02\nof kindness, of justice, of human essence and its actualization...\n63:08\nAll of these are notions and concepts that have been created within our civilization,\n63:16\nour knowledge system and our form of philosophy,\n63:21\nand that as a result they form part of our class system;\n63:26\nand one can't, however regrettable it may be, put forward these concepts\n63:34\nto describe or justify a fight which should -- and shall in principle -\n63:41\noverthrow the very fundaments of our society.\n63:45\nThis is an extrapolation for which I can't find the historical justification.\n63:53\nWell, I think we can immediately start the discussion.\n64:04\nMr. Chomsky, I would like to ask you one question.\n64:06\nIn your discussion you used the term \"proletariat\", \"we as proletarians\";\n64:14\nit's the irony of history that the moment young intellectuals\n64:18\ncoming from the middle class and upper class,\n64:20\ncall themselves proletarians and say we must join the proletariat.\n64:26\nBut I don't see any class-conscious proletarians. And that's a great dilemma.\n64:31\nIt is not true in our given society that all people are doing useful, productive work,\n64:39\nor self-satisfying work -- obviously that's very far from true.\n64:42\nLots of people are excluded from the possibility of productive labor.\n64:49\nAnd I think the revolution, if you want, should be in the name of all human beings;\n64:53\nbut it will have to be conducted by certain categories of human beings, and those will be,\n65:00\nI think, the human beings who really are involved in the productive work of society.\n65:04\nNow what that is will differ, depending upon the society. In our society,\n65:09\nit I think includes intellectual workers.\n65:12\nSo I think that the student revolutionaries, if you like, they have a point, partial point:\n65:19\nthat is, it's a very important thing in a modern advanced industrial society how the\n65:26\ntrained intelligentsia identifies themselves.\n65:29\nIf they are going to be technocrats, or servants of either the state or private power,\n65:35\nor alternatively, whether they are going to identify themselves as part of the workforce,\n65:38\nwho happen to be doing intellectual labor.\n65:40\nIf the latter, then they can and should play a decent role in a progressive social revolution.\n65:48\nIf the former, then they're part of the class of the oppressors.\n65:54\nI have one small additional question -- or rather a remark to make to you. That is:\n66:00\nyou, with your very courageous attitude towards the war in Vietnam,\n66:05\nhow can you survive in an institution like MIT,\n66:09\nwhich is known here as one of the Great War contractors and intellectual makers of this war?\n66:17\nThere are two aspects to that: one is the question how MIT tolerates me,\n66:22\nand the other question is how I tolerate MIT.\n66:24\nWell, as to how MIT tolerates me, here again, I think, one shouldn't be overly schematic.\n66:33\nIt's true that MIT is a major institution of war-research.\n66:38\nBut it's also true that it embodies very important libertarian values, which are,\n66:46\nI think, quite deeply embedded in American society, fortunately for the world.\n66:51\nThey're not deeply embedded enough to save the Vietnamese, but they're deeply enough\n66:56\nembedded to prevent far worse disasters. And here, I think, one has to qualify a bit.\n67:02\nThere is imperial terror and aggression, there is exploitation, there is racism,\n67:08\nlots of things like that. But there is also a real concern, coexisting with it,\n67:15\nfor individual rights of a sort which, for example, are embodied in the Bill of Rights,\n67:20\nwhich is by no means simply an expression of class oppression.\n67:24\nIt is also an expression of the necessity to defend the individual against state power.\n67:31\nNow these things coexist. It's not that simple, it's not just all bad or all good.\n67:36\nAnd it's the particular balance in which they coexist that makes\n67:41\nan institute that produces weapons of war be willing to tolerate, in fact,\n67:48\nin many ways even encourage to be quiet honest,\n67:50\na person who is involved in civil disobedience against the war.\n67:53\nNow as to how I tolerate MIT, that raises another question.\n67:56\nThere are people who argue, and I have never understood the logic of this,\n67:59\nthat a radical ought to dissociate himself from all oppressive institutions.\n68:05\nThe logic of that argument is that Karl Marx shouldn't have studied\n68:09\nin the British Museum which, if anything, was the symbol of the most vicious\n68:14\nimperialism in the world, the place where all the treasures an empire had gathered,\n68:19\nthe rape of the colonies, was all poured in there.\n68:21\nBut I think Karl Marx was quite right in studying in the British Museum.\n68:26\nHe was right in using the resources and in fact the liberal values\n68:30\nof the civilization that he was trying to overcome, against it.\n68:36\nAnd I think the same applies in this case.\n68:39\nBut aren't you afraid that your presence at MIT gives them a clean conscience?\n68:44\nI don't see how, really. I mean, I think my presence at MIT serves marginally,\n68:51\nI hope a lot, I don't know how much,\n68:54\nto increase student activism against a lot of the things that MIT stands for, for
