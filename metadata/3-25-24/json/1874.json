Robness created this piece in reaction to his artist friend Max Osiris getting removed from SuperRare.co for copyright and community infractions.  Robness was then removed shortly thereafter for the toter due to copyright violations.  The shitstorm that followed on twitter began a movement known as the #Trashart movement and a bunch of artists heeded the call and started creating tribute works and remixes in the from of trashcans.  To date there are more than 1000+ pieces of trashart out in the NFT/Metaverse and more continue to be made to this day.  A write up on cointelegraph magazine also attributes the toter argument similarities to legendary artist Marcel Duchamp and his infamous urinal art piece.\n\nThere is also a Trashart gallery under the name of $TRSH gallery here in town as well.  I recommend all art movement story lovers go check it out, I tried to find the best pieces I could and I still couldn't fit all the pieces in there.  Might have to make a second or even third gallery soon.  Much love and keep creating free.
