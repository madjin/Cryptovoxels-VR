The modules can be connected together with patch cords, a matrix patching system, or switches by the user to create a patch. The output (voltages) from the modules may function as (audio) signals, control voltages, or logic/timing conditions. Typical modules are oscillators (operate on frequency), filters (spectrum), amplifiers/gates (amplitude) and Envelope generators (dynamic control).\n\n","lightmap_status":"None","content":{"voxels":"eJzt2rENwkAABEEsSnNjlE5AB75g9WJMPJbQ/X7k63Md/ns9flb/ewPPL/75G+ryzu/3nvTu33zq6/3v+fyef38s/3/T/f71+f93X+9f3x91+/rnS1/vr3/9852v99e//vnO1/vrX/985+v99a9/vvP1/vrXP9/5en/965/vfL2//vXPd77eX//65ztf76//5QbY7496v/r8/7uv9/f979n3B8+vvu33C//JmUE=","features":[{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgUQb3VL88M","type":"youtube","uuid":"139a53af-c782-46d9-bf1f-8592804bdb58","scale":[6,4,0],"script":"","inverted":false,"position":[0.25,3.5,7.75],"rotation":[0,0,0],"screenRatio":"169"},{"text":"Colin Benders","type":"sign","uuid":"4bd2c091-14e5-4f72-8f16-1fe63370fc38","color":"#ffffff","scale":[3.65625,0.5,0.5],"script":"","fontSize":"90","position":[0.25,5.5,7.7],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[]},"blendMode":"Screen","background":"#000000"}],"scripting":false},"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"island":"Origin City","kind":"plot","minted":true}}
