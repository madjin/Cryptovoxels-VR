His technique is to live construct loops and melodies using hardware synthesizers. Some call it DAWless. His style is IDM / House / DnB. His key is almost always C Minor. He really likes buying synths, possibly more than making actual music.\n\nSome favourite synthesizers in the rig:\n\n* Sequential Pro 3\n* Moog Sub 37\n* Elekton Analog RYTM\n* Elekton Analog Four\n\nPlay some of the videos to see a sample of Skeezy Vibes music.
