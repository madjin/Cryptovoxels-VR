They were having children at this time, that needed the land and crystals to develop their activities. Drog, from the Earth faction, decided to put on vote the new land reform law. The blacksmiths, leaded by Anna, built their new Fire faction and joined the miners, from the new Earth faction, and they had mined Abundance until the other factions retunred.","collection_id":294,"collection_name":"The Philosopher Brand","collection_address":"0xBbf177CE3afeFFa489f06D6Cf928Cd1D58b7DE30"},"showTryOnPopUp":false},{"url":"https://media.crvox.com/0xb7d3a787a39f25457ca511dc3f0591b546f5e02f/1638725966195-6d7873c7-a674-4bcd-a335-a7c88fdf3e1a.vox","type":"vox-model","uuid":"94ffeb17-9afe-49a9-815a-e42e89d5838a","flipX":true,"scale":[2,2,2],"version":"15062","position":[-2.25,0.9,2.5],"rotation":[0.69813,-0.7854,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[],"destination":null}},{"url":"https://media.crvox.com/0x36354da80c30e3b1045ae2dd7640a99d12d7bcbb/1644907630598-14035ed8-bb32-40e0-a80f-bac1bfa491bd.vox","type":"megavox","uuid":"bc448252-1cf8-48f3-9601-b881e5b09d9a","flipX":true,"scale":[6.1,3.5,4.8],"version":"20733","position":[-0.17,-1.19,0.32],"rotation":[0,0,0],"animation":{"keyframes":[],"destination":null}},{"url":"https://i.gifer.com/origin/19/195c4db0e36f6d3c0e331568b7c292ae_w200.gif","type":"image","uuid":"b2c40fb5-4fbd-4941-9125-2aff11b01d3d","scale":[3.8,5.6,0],"uScale":1,"vScale":1,"opacity":"1.00","stretch":true,"version":"20733","position":[-1.42,1.29,0.04],"rotation":[1.5707963267948966,-0.004351767488490896,0],"blendMode":"Combine","transparent":false,"updateDaily":false},{"type":"megavox","scale":[0.6,0.6,0.6],"url":"https://media.crvox.com/0xb7d3a787a39f25457ca511dc3f0591b546f5e02f/sheep_pink_1_1726733b4c13f46675996d26591877a7.vox","flipX":true,"position":[1.2,1.25,1.07],"rotation":[0,-1.45,0],"version":"31740","uuid":"4e83285b-fdc4-4506-b9b3-6afad444501e"}]},"settings":{"sandbox":false,"hosted_scripts":false},"island":"Scarcity","kind":"plot","minted":true}}
