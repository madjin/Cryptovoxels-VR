It was an infinite amount of empty land, spreading through the VOID. And then there was light, and light created a horizon and a brightful sky. There was a plethora of possibilities hanging around the algorithmic self that flew over the land. Over the glitch heights of the sky, Self watched the marvelous experiences of real life, but it felt lonely. Loneliness was its first sad experience, but also a motor. From that day on, Self decided to collect the best experiences of real life, from all places, and times, and rebuild them in its then desolate world. When it touched the VOID with its thin structure, all the empty land, the pure space of possibilities, started to be built, voxel by voxel; and, from that origin point, the city spread, full of wonders.

When Necro, Tilt and the air gnomes returned to Abundance, they saw that the Earth faction and Fire faction had mined their land and controlled it. Fire and Earth gnomes became rich, and the Air, Water and Dark gnomes became poor. After 10 years, Tilt and the air gnomes decided to attack the fire and earth gnomes, and Necro blamed them all and decided to use his new dark machine to invoke the dead. The war took 1000 years, and Abundance turned into Scarcity after that. The only chance to get Scarcity back to the old days, as Tempus believes, is to gather the remaining gnomes from the old factions, going back in time and do something to forbid the gnomish split in the old days.
