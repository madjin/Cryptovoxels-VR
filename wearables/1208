The Dreamverse was once a layered reality sustained by dormant humans, creating a massive hive dream. Humans left their inner universes and decided to evolve in their waking state, only a few remain using the old ways of connecting with each other.\nWith the hat on, you will be able to enter the dreams of someone sleeping, but be careful to leave their mind before they wake up, or you'll have a hard time coming back.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"vox","value":"https://www.voxels.com/w/aa8dc0610bc983e5026b1b569d0147659f23bf76/vox"},{"trait_type":"author","value":"ToxSam"},{"trait_type":"issues","value":25},{"trait_type":"rarity","value":"epic"},{"trait_type":"suppressed","value":false}],"external_url":"https://www.voxels.com/collections/eth/0xa58b5224e2fd94020cb2837231b2b0e4247301a6/1208","background_color":"f3f3f3"}
