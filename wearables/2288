Because voxels are better when everything is square, including your avatar! Limited to 1024 pieces, and you can add eyes, mouth and other characteristics to your square face. Price of CryptoCraft's items will increase when more gets minted. The assets like eyes and mouth, are specially designed for the CryptoCraft series, but you could use them in other face surfaces, too; that's the purpose of Ethereum, as no item should be exclusively attached to a single market.","attributes":[{"trait_type":"vox","value":"https://www.voxels.com/w/dbb7d27db5af5395cf41c582f497f47ce690fbbd/vox"},{"trait_type":"author","value":"daniellmesquita.eth"},{"trait_type":"issues","value":1024},{"trait_type":"rarity","value":"common"},{"trait_type":"suppressed","value":false}],"external_url":"https://www.voxels.com/collections/eth/0xa58b5224e2fd94020cb2837231b2b0e4247301a6/2288","background_color":"f3f3f3"}
